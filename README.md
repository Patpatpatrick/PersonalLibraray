## Push on week 2

--- I added two packages, **model** and **ui** respectively into my project.

--- In model package, I tried to add the fundamental elements that a "library" may interact with.

----**Book**, **CD**, **Borrower**. I've added some normal attributes (as well as Getters and Setters) that such classes may possess.

----I also hope to add the **publication** class in this package because both books and CDs are sort of publication.

----So I hope later on **publication** can act as the parent class of **Book** class and **CD** class.

----In that way my application may add features that has something to do with polymorphism.


--- I added **Library** class into the **ui** package.

----There is a main method in **Library**, it can receive the input of a user. It also has a loop.
